## ðŸ•Œ Mughal Majesty: Bazra Shahi Masjid

The Shahi Mosque, located in Bajra Union of Sonaimuri Upazila, Noakhali District, is a historical landmark built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah in 1741-42 AD by Aman Ullah. The mosque features three eastern doors topped with semi-domed vaults and flanked by narrow minarets, showcasing exquisite Mughal architectural style. Between 1911 and 1928, it was extensively renovated by the Bajra Zamindars, Khan Bahadur Ali Ahmad and Khan Bahadur Muzir Uddin Ahmad, who adorned it with intricate ceramic mosaics. The Bajra Shahi Mosque is a rectangular structure measuring 16 meters by 7.32 meters, oriented north-south. It features octagonal turrets at its four outer corners. The mosque has five doors: three on the east, and one each on the north and south sides. The doors are slightly projected outward, with narrow minarets flanking both sides of each door. On the qibla wall, aligned with the three eastern doors, there are three mihrabs, with the central one being larger than the others. Inside, the mosque is divided into two chambers, which are further sectioned into three parts by multi-cusped transverse arches. The roof supports three domes, which are octagonal in shape and adorned with lotus motifs and kalash finials at their apex, adding to the architectural elegance.
